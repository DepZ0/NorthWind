        USE GET request
    To get some info from Tables from DataBase use:

        /products - you need this route to get info from Products;
        .......
        At here we have this all routes :
            [/suplliers, /products, /orders, /employees, /customers].
    --
    Pagination: 20 objects for 1 page.
    --
    So, in this Project we can use Choose "supllier"/"order".... by ID, example for it:
        /products/5 - in this example we get only 1 object where we have chosen ID.
        So, for use choose by id we need to point /"route"/"id".
